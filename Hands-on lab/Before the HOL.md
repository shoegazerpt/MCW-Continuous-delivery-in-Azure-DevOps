# Continuous delivery in Azure DevOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

In this lab, you will configure a developer environment and download the required files for this course if you do not already have one that meets the requirements.

### Prerequisites

### Task 1: Use Azure Shell as your development environment

>**Note**: This workshop can be completed using only the Azure Cloud Shell.

1.  From the Azure web portal, launch the **Azure Cloud Shell**. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.

2.  From inside the Azure Cloud Shell type these commands to configure Git:

    ```
    git config --global user.name "<your name>"
    git config --global user.email <your email>
    ```

### Task 2: Download the exercise files

1.  Using the Azure Cloud Shell, you can download the file by executing the following command inside the Cloud Shell window (all on one line):

    ```
    curl -o studentfiles.zip https://cloudworkshop.blob.core.windows.net/agile-continous-delivery/studentfiles.zip
    ```

    **TBD: Add curl to download armtemplate ready to use**

2.  Extract the contents of the file to the new folder. Using the Azure Cloud Shell, you can execute the following command inside the Cloud Shell window:

    ```bash
    unzip studentfiles.zip
    ```

3.  When unzipped, there will be a new folder named **studentfiles**. Navigate to the newly created **studentfiles** directory.

    ```bash
    cd studentfiles
    ```
   
4.  Inside the **studentfiles** folder, there are two folders named **armtemplate** and **tailspintoysweb**. The workshop will refer to these folders throughout the exercises.

>**Note**: Using the Azure Cloud Shell, you can load the integrated code editor at any time with the following command:
```
code .
```

You should follow all steps provided *before* starting the Hands-on Lab.
